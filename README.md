# Task Eleven - Web Frontend

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple interactive web page using **HTML and JavaScript**.  
The page contains an image that **disappears when hovered over** and **reappears when the mouse leaves**.  
Additionally, there is a button to manually toggle the image visibility.  

## Features
- Hover over the image to make it disappear.
- Move the mouse away to make the image reappear.
- Button to show/hide the image manually.
- Fun scaling animation when hovering over the image.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. Hover your mouse over the image → it disappears.
3. Move the mouse away → it reappears.
4. Click the "Show/Hide Image" button → toggle the image manually.
